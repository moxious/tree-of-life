# Product Context - Tree of Life Application

## Why This Project Exists

The Tree of Life application addresses a fundamental gap in digital tools for studying Kabbalistic mysticism and Western esotericism. Traditional learning materials are often static, fragmented, or require extensive prior knowledge to navigate effectively.

## Problems It Solves

### 1. Fragmented Learning Experience
- **Problem**: Traditional Kabbalistic study requires multiple books, charts, and references
- **Solution**: Centralized, interactive platform with all correspondences in one place

### 2. Complex Relationship Visualization
- **Problem**: The Tree of Life's intricate relationships are difficult to understand from static diagrams
- **Solution**: Interactive hover effects and dynamic information display

### 3. Multiple Correspondence Systems
- **Problem**: Students must cross-reference multiple systems (astrology, tarot, Hebrew letters, etc.)
- **Solution**: Integrated display showing all correspondences simultaneously

### 4. Accessibility Barriers
- **Problem**: Traditional materials often require expensive books or specialized knowledge
- **Solution**: Free, web-based tool accessible to anyone with internet

## How It Should Work

### Core User Journey
1. **Discovery**: User lands on the application and sees the Tree of Life
2. **Exploration**: User hovers over sephirot or paths to learn about them
3. **World Switching**: User explores different levels of reality (Four Worlds)
4. **Mode Switching**: User toggles between traditional and tarot card views
5. **Learning**: User absorbs information through visual and textual correspondences

### Key Interactions
- **Hover States**: Immediate feedback with detailed information
- **World Selection**: Seamless switching between Atziluth, Briah, Yetzirah, and Assiah
- **Visualization Modes**: Toggle between sphere and card representations
- **Information Panel**: Contextual display of correspondences

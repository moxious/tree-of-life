# Active Context - Tree of Life Application

## Current Work Focus

The Tree of Life application is in a **mature, functional state** with all core features implemented. The application successfully provides an interactive visualization of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life with comprehensive correspondences and multiple visualization modes.

## Recent Changes

### Completed Features
- ✅ **Core Tree Visualization**: SVG-based rendering of 10 sephirot and 22 paths
- ✅ **Four Worlds System**: Complete implementation of Atziluth, Briah, Yetzirah, and Assiah
- ✅ **Dual Visualization Modes**: Sphere mode and tarot card mode
- ✅ **Interactive Hover System**: Sophisticated hover detection with information display
- ✅ **Comprehensive Data**: Complete correspondence system with Hebrew, astrological, tarot, and elemental associations
- ✅ **Visual Assets**: Custom images for all sephirot in all four worlds
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface with modern CSS
- ✅ **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Live deployment at `/tree-of-life/` subdirectory

### Current State
- **Status**: Production-ready application
- **Deployment**: Live on GitHub Pages
- **Code Quality**: Well-structured React components with TypeScript
- **Performance**: Optimized for fast loading and smooth interactions

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Code Maintenance**: Regular updates to dependencies and security patches
2. **User Feedback**: Collect and analyze user experience data
3. **Documentation**: Ensure all features are properly documented

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Accessibility Improvements**: Better screen reader support and keyboard navigation
2. **Performance Optimization**: Further optimization for mobile devices
3. **Educational Features**: Guided tours or beginner-friendly introductions
4. **Additional Visualizations**: New ways to explore the tree structure

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions
- **State Management**: Using React's built-in state management rather than external libraries
- **SVG Rendering**: Chose SVG over Canvas for better accessibility and scalability
- **Static Data**: All data stored in JSON configuration file for simplicity
- **Component Architecture**: Functional components with hooks for modern React patterns

### Design Decisions
- **Hover System**: Complex hover logic to prevent conflicts between sephirot and paths
- **Color Scheme**: Traditional Kabbalistic colors with modern gradients
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy with Hebrew and English text
- **Layout**: Three-panel layout with tree, controls, and information

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Patterns
- **Functional Programming**: Prefer pure functions and immutable data
- **Component Composition**: Small, focused components with single responsibilities
- **Props Interface**: Clear TypeScript interfaces for all component props
- **Event Handling**: Callback props for parent-child communication

### Styling Patterns
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Use CSS variables for consistent theming
- **Modern CSS**: Leverage CSS Grid, Flexbox, and modern features
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
- **Animation**: Smooth transitions and hover effects

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technical Learnings
1. **SVG Complexity**: Managing complex SVG interactions requires careful state management
2. **Hover Conflicts**: Preventing multiple simultaneous hovers requires sophisticated logic
3. **Image Optimization**: SVG patterns work well for dynamic image display
4. **Performance**: Static data and efficient re-renders provide good performance

### User Experience Learnings
1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Users appreciate being able to explore at their own pace
2. **Visual Feedback**: Immediate hover responses are crucial for engagement
3. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Accurate Hebrew text and respectful treatment of sacred symbols
4. **Educational Value**: The tool serves both spiritual and educational purposes

### Project Management Insights
1. **Scope Management**: Focused on core features rather than trying to include everything
2. **Quality Over Features**: Prioritized polish and user experience over additional features
3. **Documentation**: Good documentation is essential for maintaining complex mystical data
4. **Community**: The project benefits from the broader Kabbalistic and esoteric community

## Current Challenges

### Technical Challenges
- **Mobile Optimization**: Ensuring smooth performance on all mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: Making the complex visual interface accessible to all users
- **Browser Compatibility**: Ensuring consistent experience across different browsers

### Content Challenges
- **Data Accuracy**: Ensuring all mystical correspondences are accurate and well-sourced
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Balancing accessibility with respect for traditional meanings
- **Educational Value**: Making complex concepts understandable without oversimplifying

## Success Indicators

### Technical Success
- ✅ Application loads quickly and runs smoothly
- ✅ All features work as intended
- ✅ Code is maintainable and well-documented
- ✅ Responsive design works on all devices

### User Success
- ✅ Users can explore the tree without prior knowledge
- ✅ Information is presented clearly and comprehensively

| Keter    | 11, 12, 13                     | E, G♯                   | **E** (no5)                          | Only a dyad (root + maj3). Also interpretable as incomplete C♯m, but E(no5) is most straightforward. | 😌        |
| Hockmah  | 11, 14, 15, 16                 | C, C♯, E, F♯            | **Cmaj(add♯11, add♭9)**              | C root: E = 3, F♯ = ♯11, C♯ = ♭9. Cluster-y; alt. C♯m(add4, add6).                                   | 🌶️🌶️🌶️ |
| Binah    | 12, 14, 17, 18                 | D, D♯, E, F♯            | **D(add9, ♯9)**                      | D root: F♯ = 3, E = 9, D♯ = ♯9. Ambiguous—also could be an E chord with clashing maj7/♭7.            | 🌶️🌶️    |
| Hesed    | 16, 19, 20, 21                 | C♯, E, F, A♯            | **C♯m6(add11, no5)**                 | C♯ root: E = ♭3, F = 11, A♯ = 6. Alternate Fmaj7(#11).                                               | 🌶️🌶️    |

| Netzach  | 21, 24, 27, 28, 29             | A♯, G, C, B             | **G7sus4(♭9)** (no7)                 | G root: C = sus4, B = 3, A♯ = ♭9. Strongest conventional fit.                                        | 🌶️       |
| Hod      | 23, 25, 27, 30, 31             | G♯, D, C                | **Caug(add9)**                       | C root: G♯ = ♯5, D = 9. Bright augmented chord.                                                      | 🌶️       |
| Yesod    | 26, 28, 30, 32                 | A, A♯, D                | **A7sus4(♭9)** (no7)                 | A root: D = sus4/11, A♯ = ♭9. Dominant-sus color.                                                    | 🌶️       |
| Malkuth  | 29, 31, 32                     | B, C, A                 | **B7(♭9)** (no3, no5)                | B root: C = ♭9, A = ♭7. Classic dominant ♭9 shell.                                                   | 🌶️       |

Totals for Iteration 1

Total pepper count: 7

Total 😌 count: 14

Notes & next steps

This mapping already yields a lot of 😌 rows (14/20), clustering the necessary color mostly at Tiferet (Above) and a few sus dyads.

We successfully used 9/12 pitch classes (C, C♯, D, E♭, E, F, F♯, G, A, B♭). Missing: G♯/A♭, D♯/E♭ is covered, A♯/B♭ is covered — actually only G♯ is missing now.

Iteration 2 plan (if you want): Introduce G♯ on a low-impact path while keeping local chords conventional—e.g., swap a dyad edge in a way that forms a normal triad at one of its endpoints (or keep the single-tone “Above/Below” rows as the accidental carriers). We’ll then re-score peppers and compare.
